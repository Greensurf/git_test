<h1>Homepage</h1>
<h2>Link on same page</h2>
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>

<h2>Links in new tab</h2>

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me</a>

<!-- rel= is used to describe the relation between current page and linked doc.
     norefferer prevents link from knowing which webpage has a link to it.
     href specifies the destination link
     target specifies where the linked resource will be opened 
     _self opens link on currnt tab

     noopener prevents phishing attacks 
     err on side of caution when coding links good practice to pair target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer"
